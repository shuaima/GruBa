\section{Incremental Algorithms}
\label{sec-IncAlg}

We next present auxiliary data structures for \inc,
and then present algorithm \incp and \incd to handle pattern and data updates, respectively.
We finally present \inc by integrating \incp and \incd together.
%We finally unify pattern and data updates by integrating \incp and \incd together.
