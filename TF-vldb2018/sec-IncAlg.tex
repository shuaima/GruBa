\section{Incremental Algorithms}
\label{sec-IncAlg}

In this section, we introduce the details of our incremental algorithm \inc, including (a) auxiliary data structures,
(b) algorithms \incp and \incd to handle pattern and data updates, respectively, and (c) \inc by integrating \incp and \incd together.
%We finally unify pattern and data updates by integrating \incp and \incd together.
